## How can you get exercises data with API ?
Go to [ExercisesDB page](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb) , create an `account` on rapidapi website and copy the value of `X-RapidAPI-Key` to the `.env-example` file.

Example of correctly pasted value:
```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=efks20012dsaa230
```

When done, rename the file from `.env-example` to `.env`.

From now on, your API connection is working.
